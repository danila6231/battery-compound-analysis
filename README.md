# Battery Properties Prediction

This is a study on battery materials property prediction. We explore the dataset presented and apply various data mining/machine learning techniques to analyze this dataset and predict properties such as Capacity, Voltage, Efficiency, Energy, and Conductivity of the battery based on the compound formula. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a certain degree of predictive efficiency using machine methods.
